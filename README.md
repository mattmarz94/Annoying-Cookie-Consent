# Annoying-Cookie-Consent

I built a very annoying cookie consent form in order to give me more practice and open myself up to more JavaScript language.

I will list everything I have used and learned while creating this consent form.

1. I used the setTimeout method to control when the modal appeared on the screen once it loaded in.

2. I used the element.style property to update an elements CSS property using JS without having to clutter the code.

3. I learned how to create an HTML form with the input types of "text", "email", and "password".

4. Once the form was created, i used the formData object to get data from our form, but as an Object.

5. Next, i used the .get() method to access the data from the formData object so we could use it in our app.

6. I learned how to use the classlist.toggle() function to toggle on/off the button swithing, and learned to add the reverse input into css as to where i call it from. 

7. Lastly, I learned how to use the disabled attribute in an HTML element and also in the JavScript I learned it is a boolean value, so i needed to write if/when the value will need to be false in order to block users from closing the pop-up until the setTimeout method allowed it to do so.
